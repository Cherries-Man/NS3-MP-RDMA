# MP-RDMA simulation

This is a MP-RDMA NS-3 simulator based on the [HPCC: https://hpcc-group.github.io/](https://hpcc-group.github.io/) implementation for simulating the performance of MP-RDMA(Multi-Path RDMA).

## NS-3 simulation

The ns-3 simulation is under `simulation/`. Refer to the README.md under it for more details.

## Traffic generator

The traffic generator is under `traffic_gen/`. Refer to the README.md under it for more details.

## Analysis

HPCC provide a few analysis scripts under `analysis/` to view the packet-level events, and analyzing the fct in the same way as [HPCC](https://liyuliang001.github.io/publications/hpcc.pdf) Figure 11.
Refer to the README.md under it for more details.
